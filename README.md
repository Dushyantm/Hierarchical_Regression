# Hierarchical Regression: A Bayesian Simulation Technique using the PyMC3 Library
Music industry is growing day by day and with the rise of digital music platforms like Spotify, 
it has become increasingly important to understand the factors that influence the popularity of an artist and their tracks. 

In this article, we will be discussing a method to predict the popularity of an artist based on the popularity of their tracks. 
This method is called Hierarchical Regression and we will be using the PyMC3 library to perform this analysis.

### What is Hierarchical Regression?
* Hierarchical Regression is a statistical technique used to model a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables while considering the grouping or clustering of the data.
* In this method, the independent variables are first grouped into clusters or subgroups based on some common characteristics and then a separate regression analysis is performed for each group. 
* This results in a more accurate and robust model compared to traditional regression analysis as it takes into account the heterogeneity of the data and also reduces the variability in the estimates.

### PyMC3 Library
* PyMC3 is a Python library for probabilistic programming that allows users to perform Bayesian analysis. 
* It is a flexible library that supports the creation of models using an intuitive syntax, and it provides a variety of statistical models including linear regression, logistic regression, and hierarchical models. 
* PyMC3 also provides a variety of sampling algorithms to fit the models including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.


#### In this Notebook, we focused on the use of hierarchical regression in a Bayesian simulation technique using the PyMC3 library. 

### Conclusion
Hierarchical Regression is a powerful technique that can be used to model complex data structures while taking into account the heterogeneity of the data. 
PyMC3 is a flexible and user-friendly library that makes it easy to perform Bayesian analysis and perform Hierarchical Regression. 
This example demonstrates the use of PyMC3 to perform a Hierarchical Regression on a Spotify music corpus, and it shows that the results are accurate and reliable.
